To cleanup and avoid any additional charges, the cluster created as part of the lab needs to be deleted from the OpenSearch Service Console. 

Select the Domain we created as a part of this lab, click **Delete** and confirm the deletion. This should clean up all instances and resources associated to this Domain.
